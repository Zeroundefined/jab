The locate module
=================

	>>> import locate
	>>> print locate.__doc__
	Methods to run the locate script more exactly

More modules for testing
------------------------
	
	>>> import os

locate
------

The script will need to run locate commands
	>>> print locate.make_locate_command('fred')
	/.../locate fred

The standard locate command gives many files for its own name
	>>> lines = locate.run_locate('locate')
	>>> len(lines) > 10
	True

But the module cuts that down to just the files named locate
	>>> lines = locate.locate('locate')
	>>> len(lines) < 10
	True

And everything found has just the filename as "locate"
	>>> not [l for l in lines if os.path.basename(l) != 'locate']
	True
