The update_hosts module
=======================

    >>> import update_hosts
    >>> print update_hosts.__doc__
    A program to update /etc/hosts from our defintions

Read/write hosts lines
----------------------

Lines in hosts files have IP addresses and names
    >>> ip = '127.0.0.1'
    >>> names = ['here', 'localhost']

Can write out a line with thos
    >>> line = update_hosts.format_line(ip, names)

IP at start, names at end
    >>> line.startswith(ip) and line.endswith(names[-1])
    True

And we can parse them back in again
    >>> (ip, names) == update_hosts.parse_line(line)
    True

Read a hosts file
-----------------
    
Reading a full file gives some lines
    >>> lines = update_hosts.read_host_lines('/etc/hosts')

Comment lines are preserved, but have no names
    >>> non_comment_lines = [(ip, names) for ip, names in lines if names]

Very often the first non-comment line defines localhost
    >>> ip, names = non_comment_lines[0]
    >>> 'localhost' in names
    True
