The dates module
================

now() is hard to test, reproducibly

    >>> import dates
    >>> p = makepath('test_me_now')
    >>> if p.exists(): p.remove()

Make a file, now
    >>> p.touch()

Get the date/time now
    >>> now = dates.now()

Find the creation time of the created file
    >>> import time
    >>> year, month, day, hour, minute, second, _, _, _ = time.gmtime(p.getctime())
    >>> p.remove()

Test that the call to now was within a second of when the file was created
    >>> now.year == year and now.day == day and now.second == second
    True
