#! /bin/cat

If I have any of these back them up now

    grep link bin/link_dots

Go $HOME
    
    cd

Check out from the main branch of the repository

    git clone https://github.com/jalanb/dotjab.git
    JAB=$(readlink -f dotjab)

Run the setup script

    cd dotjab/server
    bash setup.sh

Or, as it is always "a work in progress" I might be better off with
    cat setup.sh

Link the dot files

    cd -
    bash $JAB/bin/link_dots

Whichever way gets it done, complete it by:
    Logout and in
