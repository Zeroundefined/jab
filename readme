#! /bin/cat

If I have any of these back them up now

	rm -rf ~/.jab
	rm -rf ~/.vim
	rm -rf ~/.vimrc

Go $HOME
	
	cd

Check out from the main branch of the repository

	svn co https://repository.altobridge.com/jab .jab

Run the setup script

	cd .jab/server
	bash setup.sh

Or, as it is always "a work in progress" I might be better off with
	cat setup.sh

Whichever way gets it done, complete it by:
	Logout and in


Smile :-)
