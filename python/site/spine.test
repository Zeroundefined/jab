The site/spine module
=====================

	>>> import spine
	>>> print spine.__doc__
	Show the spine of a class

A Thing is a kind of Spine
	which can provide a string value
	>>> class Thing(spine.Spine):
	...     def __str__(self):
	...         return 'string'

Instantiate a thing
	>>> thing = Thing()

The repr() includes the string value
	>>> thing
	<Thing 'string'>

Names are as expected
	>>> thing.full_class_name() == '__main__.Thing' and thing.class_name() == 'Thing' and thing.list_name() == 'Things'
	True

One fish, two fish
------------------

	>>> class Fish(spine.Spine):
	...     pass
	>>> fish = Fish()

Plurals are handled properly
	>>> fish.class_name() == fish.list_name()
	True
