Testing the try script
===========================

There is more text in here than I'd normally use in *.tests
But doctest got verbose when I called it *.test, showing:
	*** DocTestRunner.merge: 'try.test' in both testers; summing outcomes.

So this file is called try.tests
	>>> print test.path
	try.tests

If that went well we have a hidden variable called test
	which is an object from the __main__ module
	and has some attributes

	>>> spread(test)
	<__main__.Test_Being_Run
		username : 'jab'
		path_to_test : <FilePath u'/Users/jab/.jab/python/testing/try.test'>
		path_to_py : <FilePath u'/Users/jab/.jab/python/testing/try.py'>
		here : <DirectPath u'/Users/jab/.jab/python/testing'>
		host : 'jab.ook'
		path_to_tests : <FilePath u'/Users/jab/.jab/python/testing/try.tests'>
		user : 'jab@jab.ook'
		path : <DirectPath u'try.tests'>
		home : <DirectPath u'/Users/jab'>
		path_to_fail : <FilePath u'/Users/jab/.jab/python/testing/try.fail'>
	>

We also have access to some modules I often use
	without a need for explicit import

	>>> test.path.name == makepath(sys.argv[0]).name
	True

You should be reading this in a file called try.tests
	>>> print test.path
	try.tests

Which originated on my Mac 
	but now lives on the Dell
	>>> print test.user, test.home, test.path.abspath()
	jab@... /.../jab /.../.jab/python/testing/try.tests

While we're here, where are we ?
	>>> print test.here
	/.../.jab/python/testing

And we can run bash commands
	>>> bash('ls try.tests')
	try.tests
	True
