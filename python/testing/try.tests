Testing the try script
===========================

There is more text in here than I'd normally use in *.tests
But doctest got verbose when I called it *.test, showing:
	*** DocTestRunner.merge: 'try.test' in both testers; summing outcomes.

So this file is called try.tests
	>>> test.path.name == 'try.tests'
	True

If that went well we have a hidden variable called test
	which is an object from the __main__ module
	and has some attributes

	>>> test.path_to_py.name == 'try.py'
	True

	>>> import os
	>>> print test.here == os.getcwd()
	True

We also have access to some modules I often use
	without a need for explicit import
	Which ignores the heuristic that 
		"Explicit is better than implicit"
	>>> test.path.name == makepath(sys.argv[0]).name
	True

And we can run bash commands
	>>> bash('ls ~/.bashrc')
	/.../.bashrc
	True

	>>> print test.home == makepath('~')
	True

We know the user who is running the tests
	>>> print test.user == '%s@%s' % (os.environ['USER'], test.host)
	True
